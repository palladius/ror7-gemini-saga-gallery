  "caption": "A blue, yellow, and orange nudibranch, a type of sea slug, stands out against the muted green, brown, and gray of the surrounding coral reef. The nudibranch itself has a striking pattern - a bright blue body with several yellow longitudinal stripes, accented by orange trim on its external gills and foot. The coral reef provides a textured backdrop with its rough and irregular surface. Its colors are more subdued, with pale blue, white, and beige tones.",
  "technicalities": "The image is slightly blurry, especially around the edges. The lighting is adequate to see the subject but could be better for a crisper image.",
